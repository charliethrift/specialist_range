## Title 
Floral specialization correlates with restricted range size in bees across five families

## Question
1. Is there a correlation between species range size and diet in bees?

## Methods Summary
1. Estimate range size in bee species (extent of occurrence) using convex-hulls, with cleaned global occurrence data from Dorey et al., 2023
2. Quantify diet as the number of plant genera a bee species collects pollen from, with pollen data from Wood et al., 2023
3. Analyze the relationship between range and diet using linear models

## Results Summary
- Range size is significantly correlated to diet breadth in bees. Bees with more specialized diets are likely to have smaller range sizes.
- This relationship is not identical in all 5 bee families we test.
